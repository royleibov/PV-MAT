# PV-MAT

The name PV-MAT (Panoramic Video - Measurement and Tracking) is an ironic play on The Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT - There's nothing ideal about the chaotic movement of real-life objects.

PV-MAT creates a panorama out of a video and lets the user make measurements on it and track objects' paths and speeds.
