# PV-MAT (Panoramic Video - Measurement and Tracking)

The name PV-MAT is an ironic play on The Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT - There's nothing ideal about the chaotic movement of real-life objects.

PV-MAT creates a panorama out of a video and lets the user make measurements on it and track objects' paths and speeds.

# Installation

To directrly install PV-MAT to your computer choose the appropriate file for your operating system from [this folder](https://mega.nz/folder/ip1HQLLT#3_Qnl3GPnD9Ek6tTnrqAxw).

- **[MacOS:](https://mega.nz/file/e590WI6K#bjzjBUwIyd9jlPEXqiQZQ5MokuQTK9qk7CX9CxIAOMI)** After unzipping the ```PV-MAT for MacOS.zip``` file, you can double click ```PV-MAT.app``` to open. If an *"Unidentified developer"* error message pops up, right click the ```PV-MAT.app``` and choose open. The message should reapear with an ```open``` button this time.

- **[Windows:](https://mega.nz/file/20FhUKpB#6cznQwsbpUj4T1nu9jX3rayu0yAYX4113BUgLxG9L00)** After unzipping the ```PV-MAT for Windows.zip``` file (by right clicking it and selecting *Extract All*), go into the ```PV-MAT``` folder, find and double click the file called ```PV-MAT.exe``` (the ```.exe``` may be missing). If a *"Windows protected your PC"* error message pops up, click *"More info"* and *"Run anyway"*. Sometimes windows justifiably doesn't trust programs downloaded from the internet, and so tries to prevent their opening.
