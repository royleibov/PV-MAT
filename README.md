# PV-MAT (Panoramic Video - Measurement and Tracking)

PV-MAT creates a panorama out of a video and lets the user make measurements on it and track objects' paths and speeds.

The name PV-MAT is an ironic play on The Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT - There's nothing ideal about the chaotic movement of real-life objects.

# Installation

To directrly install PV-MAT to your computer choose the appropriate file for your operating system from [this folder](https://mega.nz/folder/ip1HQLLT#3_Qnl3GPnD9Ek6tTnrqAxw).

- **[MacOS:](https://mega.nz/file/e590WI6K#bjzjBUwIyd9jlPEXqiQZQ5MokuQTK9qk7CX9CxIAOMI)** After unzipping the ```PV-MAT for MacOS.zip``` file, you can double click ```PV-MAT.app``` to open. If an *"Unidentified developer"* error message pops up, right click the ```PV-MAT.app``` and choose open. The message should reapear with an ```open``` button this time.

- **[Windows:](https://mega.nz/file/20FhUKpB#6cznQwsbpUj4T1nu9jX3rayu0yAYX4113BUgLxG9L00)** After unzipping the ```PV-MAT for Windows.zip``` file (by right clicking it and selecting *Extract All*), go into the ```PV-MAT``` folder, find and double click the file called ```PV-MAT.exe``` (the ```.exe``` may be missing). If a *"Windows protected your PC"* error message pops up, click *"More info"* and *"Run anyway"*. Sometimes windows justifiably doesn't trust programs downloaded from the internet, and so tries to prevent their opening.

You can [download the demo video here](https://mega.nz/file/f9ERhYaQ#J7wMQrfppweOgWFkCc-vw-aCCHnT5u-d6UhH41NGYnQ), if you would like to tinker with the program. Feel free to test it on any video you would like.

# How does it work?

Understanding the stitching pipeline can help achieve correct panoramas for almos any video input. The program is generalizable through Expert Mode, to allow different types, angles, and speeds of videos to be correctly transformed into a panorama.

The stitching algorithm consists of 5 steps:
1. Choosing what frames to stitch - Not every frame of the video is eventually chosen for the final panorama, so as to reduce redundancy and speed up the computation. Each frame is searched for unique "key-points", special areas in the image which can be found despite spatial changes. A choice is done by minimizing the overlapping key-points between consecutive frames as much as possible.
2. Creating an Homography matrix - a matrix to relate pixels from one image to another is created - the homography matrix. 
3. Cylindrical projection - The joint space of the image-couple is then projected onto a cylinder, to correct for the warping done when panning the camera across a scene (the cylinderâ€™s curvature can be controlled by the user to allow maximum generalizability).
4. Creating the panorama - each frame is warped by the homography matrix and an stitched onto one big panorama. This is done without recalculating the homography after each stitching.
5. Attaching all the video frames to the panorama - Each frame of the video is warped and placed in the correct place on the panorama to create a Panoramic Video.

Some useful information about Expert Mode, and many more features, can be found in the Help menu present in the app.
